App issues noticed 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻

>Create quotation - make your own package - app gets stuck on loading

>Extra products which I had added previously and are not there in 
admin panel now are appearing in additional services **

>Doesn't differentiate repaint with primer or fresh paint in packages therefore ends up showing wrong 
amount initially in packages

>Testing package is still shown while it is not there in admin panel **

>Cursor not moving to next text box when enter is pressed in measurements is still pending **

>Clicking done button in exterior  or others room measurements brings us back in interior section, 
it should remain in same section when room closes, it works correctly when back is pressed but
when done is pressed it works incorrectly **

>After creating quotation, if I press back it is going back to quotation generation screen,
 product selection room wise and undoing the quote created, 
 similar problem which was at the login screen, same is happening after quote creation

>I added two deep cleaning leads, none of them were notified to the vendor,
 still in his performance it counted 2 leads, and avg GSV also it is showing as 5199, 
 while avg GSV should only be calculated from the responded leads

Good morning team, I have noticed the above issues in app and admin panel 👆🏻 

Major issue is currently when I am creating a new lead it is not getting notified to vendor, 
even though I have created only one vendor for deep cleaning in pune city, 
also when vendor didn't even had sufficient coins the lead got placed, 
maybe due to two vendors having same phone no. 
as when I created a new vendor I put random phone no.
but when I logged it with that no. it was showing different vendor details,
and that vendor was of house painting so lead was not notified to him also.
So make sure while onboarding any new vendor has a unique phone no. 
which doesn't match with existing vendor profiles
